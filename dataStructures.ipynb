They provide efficient insertion, deletion, and lookup operations.\n","\n","**Properties:**\n","- Keys must be unique/exclusive.\n","- Collisions are handled using techniques like linear probing or separate chaining.\n","- Hash maps use a hash function to denote a hash code to a key and a value.\n","- Utilizes the Put and Get methods.\n","\n","**Example**\n","- The key would be the Student ID Number.\n","- The value would be the Student Names.\n","\n","### How Do They Work?\n","\n","**Hash Tables**\n","- Have flexible sizing and easy access for values.\n","- Used for speedy insertion, deletion, and lookup.\n","- It is an array coupled with a function or hash function which takes the input of the key and outputs the value at which the key is located.\n","\n","**Collisions**\n","- If two keys hash to the same value, we have a collision!\n","- Separate Chaining creates a linked list at the hash number and uses an array of pointers in O(n/k).\n","\n","### What Makes a Good Hash Function?\n","\n","- Make use of all information provided by the key.\n","- Uniform distribution output across the table.\n","- Map similar keys to very different hash values.\n","\n","### Usage\n","- Used to store non-repeated values.\n","- Generally used to quickly identify patterns with a single variable and make a claim about them using if.\n","- `set()` in Python is a fantastic

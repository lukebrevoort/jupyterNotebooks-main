# jupyterNotebooks

This notebook is a hub of all the notes I plan to take in my CS classes and extracurrcular coursework. 
I hope for these notebooks to be a sandbox for myself and other to mess around with and gain a better understanding
of the subject matter. I take a lot of notes on paper but have found that it doens't work as well for writing code.
This jupyter notebook is meant to give another way to take notes in my computer science courses.
